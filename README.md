# Algorithms

## About
This is the implementation of simple algorithms using python with testing on a variety of input data.

## Algorithms

* _Sieve of Eratosthenes_<br>
The input data is a natural number greater than one. The function uses an algorithm to search for prime numbers from 2 to a given number inclusive and returns an array with them. In case of an input error, returns an error message.


* _Cycle shift_<br>
The input data is an array and integer. The function performs a shift to the left with a positive parameter n and a shift to the right if a negative number is passed. Returns modified array. In case of an input error, returns an error message.

* _Binary search_<br>
The input data is the minimum and maximum values at which the hidden number can be found. The function outputs a possible number, after which it expects a comment from the user, regardless of whether it is "Greater" or "Less" than the guessed one. Guessing continues until the user enters the phrase "Got it!" Doesn't return anything.

* _Sort_<br>
This file consists of 5 sorts, including insert sort, choice sort, bubble sort, fast sort, merge sort. Each of the sorts receives an unsorted array of numbers as an input value, and returns an array sorted in ascending order.

* _Generation of sequences_<br>
This file contains function which generates placements with repetitions and function which generates permutations without repetitions. Each of them receives an array of values as well as length of one combination and saves arrays with sequences in global array called "place".
