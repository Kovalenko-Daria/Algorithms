## About
This is the implementation of simple algorithms using python with testing on a variety of input data.

## Algorithms

* _Sieve of Eratosthenes_<br>
The input data is a natural number greater than one. The function uses an algorithm to search for prime numbers from 2 to a given number inclusive and returns an array with them. In case of an input error, returns an error message.


* _Cycle shift_<br>
The input data is an array and integer. The function performs a shift to the left with a positive parameter n and a shift to the right if a negative number is passed. Returns modified array. In case of an input error, returns an error message.

* _Binary search_<br>
The input data is the minimum and maximum values at which the hidden number can be found. The function outputs a possible number, after which it expects a comment from the user, regardless of whether it is "Greater" or "Less" than the guessed one. Guessing continues until the user enters the phrase "Got it!" Doesn't return anything.
